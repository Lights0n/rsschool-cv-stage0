### Some words about me

I'm 23 y.o. and in 2020 I graduated BTEU university in Ghomel (spetialisation: marketing)  
My aim is to find a friendly and active team to work together to work on joint projects   
*Honest, fair, look on thingsfrom the different angle*  
Why Front-end? Cuz during coding I feel this magic state of consciousness called [***flow***](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202)!  
I used to took English classes in Ghomel (**have B1 sertificate**)  
My englich grammar sucks a little but I got planty of experince of live communication with native speakers

Took part in 2nd European Games MINSK 2019 as a **volunteer**  
From that times I do love all the stuff wich is bound up with volunteering :)

Here is some kinds of **work** I used to do:

- a handyman in a building
- forester assistant duting deforistation
- assistant of a suwmill
- waiter in restaurant and some else

From summer 2020 untill now I work in commertical organization in Gorki (Mohilev region) in sales department.
